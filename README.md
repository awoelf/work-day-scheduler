# Work Day Scheduler

## About the Project
The Work Day Scheduler allows the user to keep track of their tasks throughout the day with this handy app. When the user inputs text into a textbox that corresponds to an hour of the workday, the user can press a button to save their changes so that they remain on the page after a page refresh.
